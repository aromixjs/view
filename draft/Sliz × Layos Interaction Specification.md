# Sliz × Layos Interaction Specification

### Sliz

Sliz is the compile-time template compiler.

It:

- compiles HTML-like syntax into typed TypeScript objects;
- generates typed `ref` targets;
- resolves server action bindings;
- generates the Layos metadata required by the compiled view.

Sliz has no browser runtime.

### Layos

Layos is the runtime.

It:

- handles browser interactions;
- dispatches RPC actions;
- collects declared action inputs;
- resolves compiled targets;
- applies server-produced effects to the DOM;
- executes `lay` tokens.

## 2. Sliz References

References use:

```html
ref:<name> ="<kind>"</kind></name>
```

Example:

```html
<input ref:userEmail="value" />
<p ref:status="innerText"></p>
<div ref:content="innerHTML">
  <dialog ref:dialog="dialog"></dialog>
</div>
```

Sliz generates typed references:

```ts
Home.userEmail;
Home.status;
Home.content;
Home.dialog;
```

The `kind` determines the reference's type and runtime behavior.

A reference is an addressable target, not a DOM object.

## 3. Actions

Server actions declare only the browser values required before RPC.

```ts
const save = action({
  input: [Home.userEmail],

  async run(c) {
    const user = await db.user.findByEmail(c.userEmail);

    if (!user) {
      Home.status = "User not found";
      Home.dialog = "open";
      return;
    }

    await db.user.update({ id: user.id });

    Home.status = "Saved";
    Home.content = renderUser(user);
    Home.dialog = "close";
  },
});
```

`input` is only for RPC inputs.

Outputs are not declared.

An action may target any compiled reference, including references belonging to unrelated components.

## 4. Input Resolution

Before RPC, Layos resolves every item in `input`.

```ts
input: [Home.userEmail];
```

produces a request containing only that value.

Unlisted browser state is not transferred.

## 5. Server Outputs

Server actions may produce effects by assigning to typed references:

```ts
Home.status = "Saved";
Home.content = html;
Home.dialog = "open";
```

The operation is determined by the reference kind.

Layos is responsible for converting these effects into browser operations.

The action does not directly manipulate the DOM.

## 6. Missing Targets

If a server output targets an element that is not mounted in the current page/session, Layos ignores that effect.

This does not fail the action.

## 7. Layos `lay` Attribute

`lay` remains the only declarative language for client-side behavior.

```html
<button lay="click:ripple"></button>
```

```html
<button lay="click:ripple dialog:[click:toggle]"></button>
```

Sliz server actions do not modify or generate `lay` values as their application-level output mechanism.

```

## 9. Core Invariants

1. Sliz is compile-time only.
2. Layos is the sole browser runtime.
3. `ref` creates typed addressable targets.
4. `input` explicitly defines RPC inputs.
5. Outputs require no declaration.
6. Actions may target unrelated components.
7. Missing output targets are ignored.
8. `lay` remains the client-side behavior language.
